# explorelogs README

This extension offers a number of goodies to explore a text log generated by pino logger. These files typically contain a list of JSON objects, one per line,
which is very hard to read. This scripts first makes it easy to reformat these
as nice JSON.

Eventually we want to add other capabilities for exploring these logs.

## Features

The only thing this extension does for now is to reformat a log files.
